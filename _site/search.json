I have a keen interest in JavaScript, Python, PHP, R,\n            C# and Java. Data Science is another field I am interested\n            in especially Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\n            \n            \n            Education:\n            Grand Valley State University (2024 -\n            Current) Masters Degree in Data Science and\n            Analytics\n            Strathmore University (2016 - 2019)\n            Bachelor’s Degree in Informatics and Computer Science\n            \n            \n            Probability as a foundation of statistical modeling\n            (objective 1)\n            \n            \n            Reflections:\n            My growth\n            Since we started learning this course this semester, I\n            feel I am proficient in the following areas of the course\n            work: Regression (linear and logistic regression), single\n            and multiple variable regression, and inference. My\n            introduction to regression gave me an impression of machine\n            learning, but after reading the study materials and watching\n            the “to watch” videos, I understood the basic difference\n            between statistical learning and machine learning.\n            Furthermore, i was able to understand the concepts of\n            generalized linear regression models such as Poisson\n            classification models and discriminant analysis, concepts\n            that were helpful in mini-competition 2 (objective 2).\n            Contrary to other coding tools, i found it interesting to\n            use available packages such as tidymodels and GLMnet to\n            build models with less code, thus focusing more on\n            addressing the task at hand than writing code from\n            scratch.\n            From this course, i was able to establish a clear\n            connection on how concepts such as discriminant analysis (a\n            concept i studied in STS 526) is useful in statistical\n            modeling especially on feature selection. Furthermore, i was\n            able to understand further understand the concept of\n            cross-validation and by using different strategies such as\n            k-fold cross-validation whereby different samples of data\n            were used in evaluating the accuracy of the model in\n            generating predictions. On the other hand, in ensuring that\n            the best model is selected, the tutorials on forward and\n            backward stepwise selection of features were helpful in\n            understanding how important variables that best fit the\n            model can be selected and how to drop unimportant variables\n            to ensure a reliable and accurate model is selected\n            (objective 3).\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Cyril Owuor\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              About me:\n              A compassionate, enthusiastic and team player, Cyril is\n              able to prioritize and bring solutions to the technology\n              world.
