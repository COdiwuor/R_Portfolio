My\n            introduction to regression gave me an impression of machine\n            learning, but after reading the study materials and watching\n            the “to watch” videos, I understood the basic difference\n            between statistical learning and machine learning.\n            Furthermore, I was able to understand the concepts of\n            generalized linear regression models such as Poisson\n            classification models and discriminant analysis, concepts\n            that were helpful in mini-competition 2 (objective 2).\n            Contrary to other coding tools, I found it interesting to\n            use available packages such as tidymodels and GLMnet to\n            build models with less code, thus focusing more on\n            addressing the task at hand than writing code from\n            scratch.\n            From this course, I was able to establish a clear\n            connection on how concepts such as discriminant analysis (a\n            concept i studied in STA 518) is useful in statistical\n            modeling especially on feature selection. Furthermore, I was\n            able to understand further understand the concept of\n            cross-validation and by using different strategies such as\n            k-fold cross-validation whereby different samples of data\n            were used in evaluating the accuracy of the model in\n            generating predictions. On the other hand, in ensuring that\n            the best model is selected, the tutorials on forward and\n            backward step-wise selection of features were helpful in\n            understanding how important variables that best fit the\n            model can be selected and how to drop unimportant variables\n            to ensure a reliable and accurate model is selected\n            (objective 3).\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Cyril Owuor\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              About me:\n              A compassionate, enthusiastic and team player, Cyril is\n              able to prioritize and bring solutions to the technology\n              world.

      "contents": "\nThe main aim of this project is to develop a logistic regression model that can be able to predict the posibility of heart disease to an individual. According to the WHO, 12 million people die annually from Heart-related conditions. Furthermore, over half of the total deaths in America are due to cardiovascular diseases. An early identification of such conditions can help patients make important decisions on lifestyle changes to improve their health status. I intend to use this project to highlight the risk factors of heart disease and predict the overall risk using logistic regression.\nData Explanation\nThe data was collected by the World Health Organization from the residents of Framingham, Massachusetts. It has over 4000 subjects and 16 variables.\n\n\n\n",
